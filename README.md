# rfcs

Proposals for the design of Attaca and associated version control systems.

## Why?

This repository exists to make it easier to discuss and document changes and
improvements to Attaca/Subito and associated projects. It also provides, to a
certain extent, a specification to refer to during implementation.

## How?

"Request For Comments" design documents, or RFCS, should be submitted as pull
requests and merged upon acceptance.  To submit an RFC, add it to the `rfcs/`
directory with the filename `rfcs/proposal-<my-feature-name>.md`, for example:
`rfcs/proposal-cowsay-integration.md`.  When it is merged, the RFC should be
assigned a sequential RFC number in place of the word `proposal`, for example:
`rfcs/0042-cowsay-integration.md`.
