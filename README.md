# rfcs
Proposals for the design of Attaca and associated version control systems

"Request For Comments" design documents, or RFCS, should be submitted as pull requests and merged upon acceptance.  To submit an RFC, add it to the `rfcs/` directory with the filename `rfcs/proposal-<my-feature-name>.md`, for example: `rfcs/proposal-cowsay-integration.md`.  When it is merged, the RFC should be assigned a sequential RFC number in place of the word `proposal`, for example: `rfcs/0042-cowsay-integration.md`.
